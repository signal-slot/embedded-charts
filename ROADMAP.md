## Development Principles

1. **Embedded-First**: Every feature must work efficiently on resource-constrained systems
2. **Zero Allocation**: Maintain no_std compatibility and static memory allocation
3. **Performance**: Optimize for speed and memory usage on embedded targets
4. **Quality**: Comprehensive testing and documentation for production use
5. **Compatibility**: Support wide range of embedded platforms and displays
