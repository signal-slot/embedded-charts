## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-02

### Added
- **Complete Chart Types**
  - Line charts with multi-series support, markers (circle, square, triangle, diamond, cross, x, star), area filling, and smooth curves
  - Bar charts with vertical/horizontal orientation, spacing control, custom colors, and stacked support
  - Pie charts with full circles, donut charts, labels, and professional styling
  - Scatter charts with multiple point shapes, size mapping for bubble charts, color mapping, collision detection, and connection lines
  - Gauge charts with multiple types (semicircle, three-quarter, full circle), animated needles, threshold zones, and value display
  - Stacked charts (both bar and line variants) with animated transitions and multi-layer data management

- **Advanced Rendering System**
  - Linear axes system with customizable ticks, labels, and formatting
  - Grid system with major/minor grids, tick-aligned grids, and custom spacing
  - Legend system with multiple orientations (horizontal/vertical) and positioning (TopLeft, TopRight, BottomLeft, BottomRight, Custom)
  - Triangle filling algorithms for efficient area rendering
  - Professional color palettes and themes optimized for different display types

- **Animation Framework**
  - Core animation system with state management, controllers, and easing functions (Linear, EaseIn, EaseOut, EaseInOut)
  - Data transition system with smooth interpolation for value changes
  - Streaming animation with unified streaming buffer, automatic memory management, and real-time updates
  - Multi-state animation with keyframe-based system and configurable easing
  - Time-based progress control with external timeline management

- **Memory Management**
  - Static allocation patterns with compile-time memory bounds
  - Heapless collections for no_std compatibility
  - Configurable capacity management with sliding window buffers
  - Memory-efficient streaming data handling

- **System Target Support**
  - Memory-constrained system support (<64KB RAM) with integer-only math
  - Standard system support (128-512KB RAM) with fixed-point arithmetic
  - Full-featured system support (>512KB RAM) with full floating-point math and animations
  - Multiple math backends (integer, fixed-point, floating-point, CORDIC, libm)

- **Comprehensive Examples**
  - 24 working examples demonstrating all chart types and features
  - Basic examples: line_chart, bar_chart, pie_chart, scatter_chart, gauge_chart, stacked charts
  - Animation examples: streaming_animation_demo, data_transition_demo
  - Interactive examples: multi_series_chart, real_time_dashboard, unified_streaming_demo
  - Production examples: temperature_monitor, production_ready_demo, theme_showcase

- **Development Infrastructure**
  - Comprehensive integration tests for all chart types and animation systems
  - Performance tests for large datasets (10,000+ points)
  - Memory usage validation and monitoring
  - CI/CD workflows with automated testing, benchmarking, and security scanning
  - Code quality tools (clippy, fmt, deny) with automated enforcement

### Changed
- Project name from "embedded-graphics-graph" to "embedded-charts" for better clarity
- API design to use consistent builder patterns across all chart types
- Memory allocation strategy to prioritize static allocation for embedded compatibility

### Fixed
- Clippy warnings reduced from 57 to 22 through comprehensive code quality improvements
- CORDIC API compatibility issues with embedded math backends
- Animation interpolation type mismatches in streaming data transitions
- Memory bounds validation in sliding window buffers
- Triangle filling algorithm edge cases for complex polygon shapes

### Security
